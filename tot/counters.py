"""Reading the counter boxes — as little of them as possible.

Only two numbers guide a decision: **0** (this queue or car is empty) and **21**
(it is full). Everything in between is the same instruction — wait. So a counter
is classified three ways and nothing else is decoded.

That is cheaper than it sounds, because the short-circuits do most of the work:

* three or more glyphs in the box  -> ``OTHER``, no matching at all
* two glyphs whose first is not 2  -> ``OTHER``, the second is never looked at
* zero glyphs                      -> ``OTHER``

so a counter reading 148 costs one segmentation pass and no correlation.

Glyphs are *not* pixel-identical between renders — the same digit picks up a pixel
or two of anti-aliasing depending on its sub-pixel position — so the matching that
does happen is normalised grayscale correlation against the exemplars mined from
the calibration frames, not bitmap equality. A match that is not confidently ``0``,
``2`` or ``1`` falls through to ``OTHER``, which is the safe direction: the bot
waits rather than acting on a misread.
