"""The game object: one frozen frame, and everything readable off it.

``refresh()`` takes exactly one screenshot and reads all 32 buttons from it. Every
property then reads that frame until the next refresh, so a condition like
``lift.can_dispatch and not game.track.is_locked`` is guaranteed to describe a
single instant rather than two moments a few milliseconds apart.

A refresh measured end to end is about 52 ms, and almost none of it is here:

    wait for a painted frame    ~25 ms   the compositor's cadence
    decode the PNG              ~27 ms   a full window, because clipping the
                                         capture makes a headed page flash
    read all 32 buttons          0.05 ms  288 probe pixels, one vectorised vote
    a counter                    0.3 ms   lazy — only the ones you ask for

The counters are lazy on purpose. A tick that only looks at button colours never
segments a single digit.
